### 🎯 Current State

**Status**: Ready for Testing 🚀

All core CRDs are implemented, tested, and packaged for deployment. The operator is **Wasabi-focused** and optimized specifically for Wasabi's S3-compatible API. The operator can be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm chart.

**Note**: Multi-provider support has been dropped to focus on Wasabi-specific features and optimizations.

### 📦 Deployment Ready

```bash
# Build and deploy
docker build -t kenchrcum/wasabi-s3-operator:latest .
helm install wasabi-s3-operator ./helm/wasabi-s3-operator \
  --namespace wasabi-s3-operator-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --set image.repository=kenchrcum/wasabi-s3-operator
```
