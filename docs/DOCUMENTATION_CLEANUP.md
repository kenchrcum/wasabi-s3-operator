   - Documentation structure overview
   - Help section

## Key Improvements

### Accuracy

## Verification

All documentation has been verified to:
- ✅ Accurately reflect current implementation
- ✅ Reference only existing files
- ✅ Use consistent terminology
- ✅ Provide clear navigation paths
- ✅ Include all necessary information

## Next Steps

To maintain documentation quality:
1. Update STATUS.md when new features are completed
2. Keep CRD specifications in sync with actual CRD definitions
3. Update examples README when new examples are added
4. Ensure all new documentation follows the established structure
